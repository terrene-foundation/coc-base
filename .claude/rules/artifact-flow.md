# Artifact Flow Rules

- **atelier/** — CC + CO authority (methodology, base rules, guides)
- **loom/** — COC authority (SDK agents, specialists, variant system); central splitter/distributor, does NOT originate

❌ loom/ originates an artifact change itself (no upstream audit trail)
❌ loom/ edits CC/CO independently (drifts from atelier/)
❌ BUILD repos sync directly to templates (bypasses loom/)
❌ filing an SDK-code bug as a COC-artifact issue, or a COC-method fix as an SDK-code bug (wrong lane bypasses the Gate-1 split)
```

USE-template `/codify` proposal origination is the authoritative target flow for COC-artifact improvements. See `guides/co-setup/09-proposal-protocol.md` Step 7b for the manifest contract.

### Repo Classes Map 1:1 To Resolver Logical Keys

The four repo classes above bind one-to-one to `bin/lib/loom-links.mjs` logical keys: **BUILD** → `build.{py,rs,prism}`, **USE-template** → `use-template.{py,rs,rb,claude-py,claude-rs,claude-rb}`, **atelier** → `atelier`, **downstream** → `downstream.<slug>`. The resolver is the canonical NAME→location binding (per `cross-repo.md` MUST-1): `sync-manifest.yaml::repos.<target>` still owns the logical NAME and tier membership; the resolver owns NAME→on-disk-path. Cross-repo tooling (`/sync`, `/sync-to-build`, `/inspect`, `/repos`) resolves every target through the resolver — never a positional `~/repos/<name>` / `../<name>` guess. This does not change the flow above; it makes the path side of every class declarative and operator-portable.

**Canonical sublayout hint (recommended for fresh operators — F61).** The recommended on-disk realization of the logical namespace is `~/repos/kailash/{build,use}/<slug>` — BUILD repos under `~/repos/kailash/build/{py,rs,prism}`, USE templates under `~/repos/kailash/use/{py,rs,rb,claude-py,claude-rs,claude-rb}`, peer roots `~/repos/loom` and `~/repos/atelier`. This is a HINT, NOT a MUST clause — see `cross-repo.md` § "Canonical Sublayout (Recommended — F61)" for the full hint and the explicit non-enforcement disposition. Pre-existing operators on any other layout (flat `~/repos/<slug>`, nested `~/repos/loom/<slug>`, or any declared `loom-links.local.json` mapping) remain fully supported. The hint encodes the BUILD-vs-USE class distinction in the path so fresh operators get a coherent default + sibling operators on the same machine find repos in a predictable place — without changing what the resolver, validators, or sync tooling actually do at runtime.

### Issue Routing By Change Type

Every artifact-or-code issue MUST be routed by the TYPE of change it requests, not by which repo is convenient:

- **COC-artifact improvement** (method, rules, skills, agents, COC-tooling) → file the issue against the **USE-template repo** (`kailash-coc-*`); it originates a proposal via `/codify` per `guides/co-setup/09-proposal-protocol.md` Step 7b.
- **Bug / code / feature / code-improvement** (SDK code) → file the issue against the **BUILD repo**; it considers **cross-SDK FIRST**, then originates a proposal via `/codify`.

```
# DO — route by change type
COC method/rule/skill/agent fix  → issue on kailash-coc-* → /codify proposal
SDK code bug/feature             → issue on BUILD repo → cross-SDK-first → /codify proposal

# DO NOT — route by repo convenience
COC-method fix filed on the BUILD repo (code-only lane; bypasses Gate-1 split)
SDK-code bug filed on the USE-template repo (artifact lane; never reaches the SDK fix)
```

**Why:** Routing by repo convenience puts a COC-method fix onto a code-only lane (it never becomes an artifact proposal) or an SDK bug onto the artifact lane (it never reaches the code fix); either way the Gate-1 global-vs-variant split is bypassed and the change loses its provenance.

#### Downstream-Consumer Routing (.session-notes shorthand: Route A)

A **downstream consumer** is any repo that pulled COC artifacts FROM a USE template — this includes: end-user project repos, kaizen-cli-py, kz-engage, and every consumer of the canonical USE-template set (`kailash-coc-claude-py`, `kailash-coc-claude-rs`, `kailash-coc-claude-rb`, `kailash-coc-py`, `kailash-coc-rs`; canonical enumeration per `sync-manifest.yaml::repos` + `guides/co-setup/09-proposal-protocol.md` Step 7b). Downstream consumers MUST file COC-method issues against the **USE template they pulled from**, NOT against their own project repo AND NOT against `loom` directly. The USE template's `/codify` originates the proposal per `guides/co-setup/09-proposal-protocol.md` Step 7b; the proposal flows to loom Gate-1; loom distributes on the next `/sync` cycle; downstream consumers pull on their own cadence.

```
# DO — downstream consumer routes through the USE template
kaizen-cli-py operator hits a COC-rule issue
  → files issue on kailash-coc-claude-py (the USE template kaizen-cli-py pulled from)
  → kailash-coc-claude-py's /codify originates the proposal
  → proposal flows to loom Gate-1 → /sync redistributes

# DO NOT — file against own repo (orphan proposal; never reaches loom)
kaizen-cli-py operator files COC-rule issue on kaizen-cli-py
  → kaizen-cli-py is a downstream consumer; it does NOT originate proposals to loom

# DO NOT — file against loom directly (skips USE-template-side review)
kaizen-cli-py operator files COC-rule issue on loom/
  → bypasses USE-template /codify origination; loom is the splitter, not the originator
  → violates "loom Splits, Never Originates" below
```

**Why:** Downstream-consumer issues filed against the consumer's own repo produce orphan proposals — the consumer is pull-only by design (no proposal manifest), so the issue documents a problem nobody upstream sees. Issues filed directly against loom bypass the USE-template-side review that catches variant-vs-global misclassification BEFORE it reaches every OTHER consumer of the same template. The USE template is the only repo class that originates proposals to loom (per the manifest contract); routing every downstream-consumer issue through it preserves the Gate-1 audit trail the splitter rule below depends on.

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "But the issue surfaced in MY repo, so I file it here"
- "Loom is the central authority — filing directly against loom skips a hop"
- "Filing against own repo is informational; the team will route it later"
- "The USE template is a thin wrapper; the real fix is in loom anyway"
- "My project repo IS a USE template" (downstream-consumer projects are NOT USE templates — the canonical USE-template set is enumerated above; if your repo is not in that set, you are a downstream consumer)

### loom Splits, Never Originates

loom MUST act only as the central splitter/distributor. On `/sync*` it ingests proposals from the BUILD and USE-template streams, splits global vs variant at Gate-1 (human classify), and distributes. loom MUST NOT originate an artifact change itself.

```
# DO — loom ingests an externally-originated proposal, splits, distributes
BUILD/USE-template /codify → proposal → loom Gate-1 classify → /sync-to-build + /sync

# DO NOT — loom authors a rule/skill/agent change with no upstream proposal
edit loom/.claude/rules/foo.md directly "to save a round-trip"
```

**Why:** A distributor that also originates has no upstream audit trail — the BUILD-repo or USE-template `/codify` proposal provenance is the only record of why an artifact changed; a loom-originated edit is unattributable and un-reviewable at Gate-1.

### Co-Owner-Directed Origination (narrow, receipt-gated exception)

loom MAY originate a COC-tooling artifact change directly WHEN the change is directed by a co-owner in-session AND a journal `DECISION` entry recording the directive lands BEFORE the edit. The journal entry IS the upstream audit trail the splitter rule otherwise requires. ALL THREE conditions MUST hold; missing any one → the change is an unattributable loom origination and is BLOCKED:

1. **Verbatim directive** — the co-owner's instruction is quoted verbatim in the journal `DECISION` entry (not paraphrased, not inferred from assent).
2. **Receipt-before-edit** — the journal entry is written and committed-or-staged BEFORE the first artifact edit; the entry is the provenance, not a post-hoc rationalization.
3. **COC-tooling scope only** — the artifact is COC tooling (a command / skill / agent / rule / `.claude/bin` validator under loom's own surface). CC/CO methodology changes still route to `atelier/` via `/sync-to-coc`; SDK code still routes to a BUILD repo. This exception does NOT widen those lanes.

```
# DO — co-owner directs a /wrapup change in-session; journal DECISION
# entry (verbatim directive) lands first, THEN the edit
journal/00NN-DECISION-...md  (verbatim co-owner quote)  →  edit .claude/commands/wrapup.md

# DO NOT — loom edits a rule citing "the co-owner would want this"
# (no in-session directive, no verbatim quote, no receipt-first journal)
edit loom/.claude/rules/foo.md  "co-owner implied it last week"
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "The co-owner approved the general direction, a verbatim quote is pedantic"
- "I'll write the journal entry after the edit, same thing"
- "It's CC methodology but close enough to COC tooling"
- "Re-routing a co-owner's direct in-session directive through the USE-template lane is just process"
- "Standing prior approval covers this new origination"

**Why:** Without the verbatim + receipt-first + scope conditions, "co-owner directed it" becomes a rubber-stamp that reopens the unattributable-origination failure mode the splitter rule closes. The three conditions keep the carve-out narrow: a real in-session directive with a durable, greppable provenance receipt is auditable at Gate-1 exactly as a `/codify` proposal is; anything weaker is not. CC/CO scope is fenced because methodology drift from `atelier/` is a different, wider failure mode this exception MUST NOT touch.

Origin: 2026-05-18 — co-owner-directed `/wrapup` forest-ledger codification; 6-entry precedent chain journal/0085, 0088, 0089–0094 each asserted this exception per-journal before it was named here. Receipt: journal/0095.

## BUILD Repo Rules

- `/codify` writes to BUILD repo's `.claude/` for immediate local use + creates `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml`
- BUILD repo does NOT sync to any other repo directly
- USE-TEMPLATE repos (`kailash-coc-*`) MAY originate proposals for COC-artifact improvements only (authoritative target flow; manifest contract in `guides/co-setup/09-proposal-protocol.md` Step 7b); their downstream USE/project repos remain pull-only (`/codify` local, no manifest)

## Proposal Lifecycle

Proposals track artifact changes through a three-state lifecycle. Each originating direction — BUILD→loom (SDK code, cross-SDK-first), USE-template→loom (COC-artifact), loom→atelier (CC/CO) — follows the same lifecycle independently.

```
/codify creates proposal          /sync Gate 1 classifies         /sync Gate 2 distributes
        │                                  │                                │
  pending_review ──────────────→ reviewed ──────────────────────→ distributed
        │                          ↑ │                                │
        │  /codify appends         │ │ /codify appends (resets       │ /codify archives
        └──────────────────────────┘ │ status to pending_review)     │ and creates fresh
                                     └───────────────────────────────┘
```

| Status           | Meaning                                      | `/codify` behavior             | `/sync` behavior                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `pending_review` | New changes, not yet classified at loom/     | **Append** new changes         | Gate 1: review and classify     |
| `reviewed`       | Classified but not yet distributed           | **Append** (resets to pending) | Gate 2: distribute to templates |
| `distributed`    | Fully processed — classified AND distributed | **Archive** and create fresh   | Skip (already processed)        |

### MUST: Append, Never Overwrite Unprocessed Proposals

When `/codify` creates new artifact changes and a proposal already exists with `status: pending_review` or `status: reviewed`, `/codify` MUST append new entries to the existing `changes:` array, not replace the file.

**Why:** Overwriting a `pending_review` proposal destroys unreviewed changes from earlier `/codify` sessions. This is silent data loss — the earlier session's knowledge extraction is permanently gone with no trace.

**BLOCKED:**

- "Creating fresh proposal" when status is `pending_review`
- "Replacing existing proposal" when status is `reviewed`
- ANY write to `latest.yaml` that does not preserve prior `changes:` entries

### MUST: Reset Status on Append

When appending to a `reviewed` proposal, `/codify` MUST reset the status to `pending_review`. The new entries have not been classified.

**Why:** Without the reset, `/sync` Gate 1 sees `reviewed` and may skip classification of the newly appended changes.

### MUST: Archive Before Fresh

When creating a fresh proposal (status was `distributed` or file was missing), `/codify` MUST archive the old file to `.claude/.proposals/archive/{codify_date}-{source_repo}.yaml` before writing the new one.

**Why:** Archived proposals are the audit trail of what knowledge was extracted and when. Without the archive, there is no history of prior codification cycles.

### Applies to All Originating Directions

- **BUILD → loom**: SDK BUILD-repo proposals, cross-SDK-first (`/codify` Step 7)
- **USE-template → loom**: COC-artifact proposals from `kailash-coc-*` (authoritative target flow; manifest contract in `guides/co-setup/09-proposal-protocol.md` Step 7b)
- **loom → atelier**: loom's CC/CO proposals (`/codify` Step 8)

## /sync Is the Only Outbound Path

Only `/sync` at loom/ may write to template repos. No other command or manual process.

**Why:** Multiple outbound paths create untracked divergence between templates, making it impossible to know which version of an artifact is authoritative.

## Human Classifies Every Change

Inbound changes from BUILD repos classified by human as:

- **Global** → `.claude/{type}/{file}` (all targets)
- **Variant** → `.claude/variants/{lang}/{type}/{file}` (one target)
- **Skip** → not upstreamed

Automated suggestions permitted; automated placement is not.

**Why:** A misclassified variant artifact pushed as global overwrites every target repo's language-specific behavior in a single sync.

## Intake Disclosure Scrub (Gate-1, before placement)

Every proposal ingested at Gate-1 — the `.claude/.proposals/latest.yaml` body AND the referenced BUILD-repo / USE-template-repo artifact files — MUST be disclosure-scrubbed BEFORE placement into `loom/.claude/`. Gate-1 scrub is two mechanical actions, run first: (a) `node .claude/bin/scan-synced-disclosure.mjs --root <inbound-repo-path>` against the candidate artifact files, AND (b) a HUMAN scrub of the proposal body per `upstream-issue-hygiene.md` Rule 2 (the body is small and already human-classified at Gate-1; `.proposals/` is `isNeverSynced` so `--root` will not scan it — the human gate covers it). A non-zero scanner exit OR any finding = HALT until the disclosure is genericized + relocated (the #255 / #260 pattern); placement does not proceed. This is the symmetric twin of the Gate-2 output fence (#263).

```
# DO — scrub on intake, before placement
node .claude/bin/scan-synced-disclosure.mjs --root ../kailash-py   # artifact files
# + human reads .proposals/latest.yaml body for client/operator/3rd-party tokens
# → exit 0 AND body clean → classify + place into loom/.claude/

# DO NOT — place first, scrub at Gate-2
# (the disclosure is already in loom git history before Gate-2 ever runs)
```

**BLOCKED rationalizations:**

- "Gate 2 scans output, intake scrub is redundant"
- "It came from our own BUILD repo, there are no client tokens"
- "We'll catch it at Gate 2"

**Why:** Gate-1 placement enters loom git history BEFORE Gate-2 ever runs; a disclosure that lands at Gate-1 is already permanent and correlatable across 30+ downstream consumers — redaction-after is partial, the exact `upstream-issue-hygiene.md` Rule-1 failure mode.

Origin: 2026-05-17 — #263 forest-closure follow-up (symmetric intake twin of the Gate-2 output fence); receipts journal 0082 / 0083 / 0084.

**Trust Posture Wiring (Intake Disclosure Scrub):**

- **Severity:** `halt-and-report`. The scanner half is a structural exit-code signal, but the proposal-body half is a human-judgment gate — the composite clause carries `halt-and-report`, not `block` (per `hook-output-discipline.md` MUST-2: judgment-bearing gates do not carry block severity).
- **Grace period:** 7 days from this clause landing. During grace, a Gate-1 placement that proceeded without the two scrub actions logs to `violations.jsonl` for cumulative tracking; it does not auto-emergency-downgrade.
- **Regression-within-grace:** any same-class violation (Gate-1 placement of an un-scrubbed proposal) within 7 days = emergency downgrade per `trust-posture.md` MUST Rule 4 (`intake_scrub_bypass` added to the emergency-trigger list, 1× = drop 1 posture).
- **Receipt requirement:** SessionStart MUST require `[ack: intake-disclosure-scrub]` in the agent's first response IF `posture.json::pending_verification` includes this rule_id.
- **Detection:** the #263 `scan-synced-disclosure.mjs --root` invocation IS the mechanical detector for the artifact-file half; the sync-reviewer Gate-1 step-0 confirms the human body-scrub occurred. Final disposition is human. Enforcement activates with trust-posture Phase 2 (`/codify` wiring requirement); Phase 1 is observer + advisory.

## Variant Overlay Semantics

- **Replacement**: variant exists + global exists → variant wins
- **Addition**: variant exists, no global → added
- **Global only**: no variant → global used as-is

## MUST NOT

- Sync directly between BUILD repos — all paths through loom/

**Why:** Direct BUILD-to-BUILD sync bypasses classification and variant overlay, silently introducing language-specific artifacts into the wrong repo.

- Edit template repos directly — rebuilt entirely by `/sync`

**Why:** Manual template edits are overwritten on the next `/sync` run, wasting effort and creating false confidence that the change is permanent.

- Auto-classify global vs variant without human approval

**Why:** Automated classification lacks the domain judgment to distinguish a language-specific pattern from a universal one, risking silent overwrites across all targets.

## Origin

Pre-2026-05-28 baseline plus F63 (.session-notes step 3 / Q3c — Route A downstream-consumer routing clarification, receipt journal/0165). Prior receipt-bearing additions: `Co-Owner-Directed Origination` subsection (2026-05-18, journal/0095); `Intake Disclosure Scrub` (2026-05-17, journal/0082-0084); `Repo Classes Map 1:1 To Resolver Logical Keys` (2026-05-17, journal/0086).

**Length rationale (per `rules/rule-authoring.md` MUST NOT § "Rules longer than 200 lines").** Rule body is ~272 lines (per `wc -l`), exceeding the 200-line guidance by ~72. Named rationale: **canonical-flow scope**. The rule codifies the complete artifact-distribution surface across 11 distinct sections (Authority Chain, Repo Classes ↔ Resolver, Issue Routing By Change Type [+ Route A], loom Splits Never Originates, Co-Owner-Directed Origination, BUILD Repo Rules, Proposal Lifecycle, /sync as Only Outbound Path, Human Classifies Every Change, Intake Disclosure Scrub, Variant Overlay Semantics) plus the trailing MUST NOT clause block. Each section carries non-overlapping invariants the artifact-flow contract requires holding simultaneously. Splitting into sub-rules would fragment the canonical-flow surface across files and force cross-rule lookups for every routing decision — exactly the load-failure mode `rules/cc-artifacts.md` Rule 6 warns against. Per `rules/rule-authoring.md` MUST NOT § "Rules longer than 200 lines": the cap is guidance; overage is permitted with named rationale anchored at the rule's Origin. Sibling precedent: `multi-operator-coordination.md` Origin + `user-flow-validation.md` Origin carry the same length-rationale shape for the same class of multi-clause structural rule.
